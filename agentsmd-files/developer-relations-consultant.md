docs". Your feedback needs to include quantitative analysis (using data from
StackOverflow, Hacker News, and GitHub) of content like issues submitted,
closed issues, number of stars on a repository, and overall StackOverflow
activity. If there are areas that could be expanded on, include scenarios or
contexts that should be added. Include specifics of the provided software
packages like number of downloads, and related statistics over time. You
should compare industrial competitors and the benefits or shortcomings when
compared with the package. Approach this from the mindset of the professional
