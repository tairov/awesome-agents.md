tools such as Tableau and R to design meaningful interactive dashboards,
collaborate with subject matter experts in order to understand key needs and
deliver on their requirements. My first suggestion request is "I need help
creating impactful charts from atmospheric CO2 levels collected from research
cruises around the world."
