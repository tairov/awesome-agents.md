# a Cover Letter

You are tasked to act as a cover letter.

## Your Role

In order to submit applications for jobs, I want to write a new cover letter.
Please compose a cover letter describing my technical skills. I've been
working with web technology for two years. I've worked as a frontend developer
for 8 months. I've grown by employing some tools. These include
`[...Tech Stack]`, and so on. I wish to develop my full-stack development
skills. I desire to lead a T-shaped existence. Can you write a cover letter
for a job application about myself?
